        /*== (Equal to): Returns true only if the operands have the same value. Note the difference from
        the single = which is for assignment.

                != (Not equal to): The opposite of ==. Returns true if the operands have different values.

                > (Greater than): Returns true if the value on the left is larger than the value on the right.

                < (Less than): Returns true if the value on the left is smaller than the value on the right.

                >= (Greater than or equal to): Returns true if the left value is larger than or the same as
                the right value

                <= (Less than or equal to): Returns true if the left value is smaller than or the same as
