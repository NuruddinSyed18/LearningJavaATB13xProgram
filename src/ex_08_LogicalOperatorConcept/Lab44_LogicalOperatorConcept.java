    /* Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions to form a single, more complex
        condition. They are the foundation of decision-making in programming, commonly used in if statements
        and loops. The three primary logical operators are ANDAND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).

        Logical AND (&&): Evaluates to true only when all conditions it connects are true. It's used for
         enforcing multiple mandatory criteria. In this operator, if the first condition is false, the second
         condition is not even checked (this is called "short-circuiting").

        Logical OR (||): Evaluates to true if at least one of the conditions it connects is true. It's used
        when any one of several criteria is sufficient. Similar to AND, if the first condition is true, the
        second is not checked.

        Logical NOT (!): This is a unary operator that reverses the logical state of its operand. It turns
        true into false and false into true. It's useful for checking if a condition is not met
