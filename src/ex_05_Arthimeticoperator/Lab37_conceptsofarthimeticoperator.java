        /*Addition (+): Adds two numbers.

               Subtraction (-): Finds the difference between two numbers.

                Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.

                Division (/): When used with integers, it performs integer division, which discards any
                fractional result. To get a decimal result, you must cast one of the numbers to a
                floating-point type like double.

                Modulus (%): This operator is very useful for finding the remainder of a division.
                 For example, it can be used to check if a number is even or odd (number % 2).

                Increment (++) and Decrement (--): These are unary operators that provide a quick way
                to add or subtract 1 from a variable's value.*/
